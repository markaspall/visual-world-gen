# DDA Front-to-Back Traversal - The Missing Piece!

## The Critical Bug:

**We were traversing octree children in ARBITRARY order, not FRONT-TO-BACK!**

### Why This Matters:

```
Ray direction: (+X, -Y, +Z) (right, down, forward)

Children without DDA ordering:
  i=0: (0,0,0) - back-left-bottom
  i=1: (1,0,0) - back-right-bottom  ← Check this first
  i=2: (0,1,0) - back-left-top
  ...
  i=7: (1,1,1) - front-right-top    ← Check this last!

Result: Hit back face before front face! ❌
```

### With DDA Ordering:

```
Ray direction: (+X, -Y, +Z)
ray_signs = (1, 0, 1) in binary = 5

Reordered traversal using XOR:
  i=0 XOR 5 = 5: (1,0,1) - front-right-forward  ← Check FIRST! ✓
  i=1 XOR 5 = 4: (0,0,1) - front-left-forward   
  i=2 XOR 5 = 7: (1,1,1) - back-right-forward
  ...
  i=7 XOR 5 = 2: (0,1,0) - back-left-backward   ← Check LAST! ✓

Result: Hit front face first! ✓
```

## The Fix (Lines 270-277):

```wgsl
// Determine ray direction signs
let ray_sign_x = u32(ray_dir.x >= 0.0);  // 1 if ray goes +X, 0 if -X
let ray_sign_y = u32(ray_dir.y >= 0.0);
let ray_sign_z = u32(ray_dir.z >= 0.0);

for (var i = 0u; i < 8u; i++) {
  // XOR reorders children front-to-back (reference shader line 469)
  let octant = i ^ (ray_sign_x | (ray_sign_y << 1u) | (ray_sign_z << 2u));
  
  if ((child_mask & (1u << octant)) != 0u) {
    // Process this child...
  }
}
```

## How XOR Achieves Front-to-Back:

### Octant Encoding:
```
Octant bits: ZYX
  000 (0) = (0,0,0) = (-X, -Y, -Z) relative to parent
  001 (1) = (1,0,0) = (+X, -Y, -Z)
  010 (2) = (0,1,0) = (-X, +Y, -Z)
  ...
  111 (7) = (1,1,1) = (+X, +Y, +Z)
```

### Ray Sign Encoding:
```
If ray_dir = (+1, -1, +1):
  ray_sign_x = 1 (going +X)
  ray_sign_y = 0 (going -Y)
  ray_sign_z = 1 (going +Z)
  ray_signs = 001 | 000 | 100 = 101 (5 in decimal)
```

### XOR Magic:
```
i=0: 0 XOR 5 = 5 = 101 = (+X, -Y, +Z) ← Closest to ray origin!
i=1: 1 XOR 5 = 4 = 100 = (-X, -Y, +Z)
i=2: 2 XOR 5 = 7 = 111 = (+X, +Y, +Z)
...
i=7: 7 XOR 5 = 2 = 010 = (-X, +Y, -Z) ← Farthest from ray origin!
```

The XOR flips the bits where the ray is going NEGATIVE, effectively reversing the order for those axes!

## Why We MUST Have This:

### Before (Broken):
```
1. Check child 0 (back corner)
2. Hit voxel at back corner - return distance
3. Render shows BACK FACE ❌
```

### After (Fixed):
```
1. Check child 5 (front corner, closest to ray)
2. Miss - continue
3. Check child 4 (next closest)
4. Hit voxel at front - return distance
5. Render shows FRONT FACE ✓
```

---

## Expected Results:

✅ **No backfaces visible** (always hit front first)  
✅ **Correct depth ordering** (near before far)  
✅ **Steps view shows only surface** (first hit terminates)  
✅ **Normals point outward** (correct face detected)  
✅ **No penetration** (can't hit interior before exterior)  

---

## Technical Note:

This is called **DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)** traversal. It ensures we visit voxels in the order the ray encounters them, which is essential for:

1. **Early termination** - Stop at first hit
2. **Correct visibility** - Near objects occlude far objects
3. **Proper normal calculation** - Entry face is the visible face

Without DDA, an octree traversal is just a tree walk with no spatial ordering guarantees!

This fix, combined with world-space coordinates, should finally give us correct ray marching! 🎯
