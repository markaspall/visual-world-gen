# Normal Calculation Fix

## The Bug: Scattered Dots in Normals View

**Cause:** We were reusing `t0` and `t1` from the traversal loop, which get overwritten as we process children!

### Example of the Bug:

```wgsl
// In traversal loop, checking node at depth 5:
let t0 = (node_min - world_origin) * inv_ray_dir;
let t1 = (node_max - world_origin) * inv_ray_dir;

// Process children...
for each child {
  let t0 = (child_min - world_origin) * inv_ray_dir;  // OVERWRITES t0!
  let t1 = (child_max - world_origin) * inv_ray_dir;  // OVERWRITES t1!
}

// Later, when we hit a leaf:
let t_near_vec = min(t0, t1);  // ‚ùå Using WRONG t0/t1 from last child!
```

Result: Normal calculated from **wrong AABB**, causing random dots!

---

## The Fix: Recalculate for Leaf Node

Like the reference shader (line 436-439), we must recalculate `t0` and `t1` specifically for the leaf node:

```wgsl
// Leaf node - we hit geometry!
if (node_tag == 1u) {
  // Recalculate AABB intersection for THIS specific leaf
  let leaf_min = node_center - vec3<f32>(node_half);
  let leaf_max = node_center + vec3<f32>(node_half);
  let t0_leaf = (leaf_min - world_origin) * inv_ray_dir;  // Fresh calculation!
  let t1_leaf = (leaf_max - world_origin) * inv_ray_dir;
  let t_near_vec = min(t0_leaf, t1_leaf);
  let t_entry = max(max(t_near_vec.x, t_near_vec.y), t_near_vec.z);
  
  // Now determine which face...
}
```

---

## Additional Fix: Adaptive Epsilon

For far-away voxels, floating point precision decreases. We use an adaptive epsilon:

```wgsl
// OLD:
let epsilon = 0.001;  // Fixed epsilon

// NEW:
let epsilon = max(0.001, abs(t_entry) * 0.00001);  // Scales with distance
```

This ensures:
- Near voxels (t_entry ‚âà 10): epsilon = 0.001
- Far voxels (t_entry ‚âà 1000): epsilon = 0.01 (larger tolerance for reduced precision)

---

## Why the Dots Happened:

```
Processing node at depth 4:
  t0 = (node_min - origin) * inv_dir = [10.5, 12.3, 8.7]

Process child 0:
  t0 = (child0_min - origin) * inv_dir = [10.6, 12.4, 8.8]  // OVERWRITES!

Process child 7:
  t0 = (child7_min - origin) * inv_dir = [11.2, 13.1, 9.3]  // OVERWRITES AGAIN!

Hit leaf in child 2:
  t_near_vec = min(t0, t1)  // Uses child 7's t0! ‚ùå
  t_entry = max(t_near_vec)
  if (t_entry == t_near_vec.x) ‚Üí X-axis normal
  
But actually hit Y-axis face! ‚Üí WRONG NORMAL ‚Üí DOT ARTIFACT!
```

## Expected Results:

‚úÖ **No scattered dots** (normals calculated from correct AABB)  
‚úÖ **Smooth normal transitions** (adaptive epsilon handles precision)  
‚úÖ **Correct face detection** (t_entry from actual leaf node)  
‚úÖ **Consistent with reference shader** (same algorithm)

## About the Circular Distortion:

The "circular" appearance at distance is **normal perspective distortion** from a wide field-of-view. It's not visible in the steps view because steps count is independent of perspective.

If you want to verify it's not a bug:
1. The steps map is clean ‚Üí traversal is correct ‚úì
2. The depth map is smooth ‚Üí distances are correct ‚úì
3. Only the rendered view looks "curved" ‚Üí perspective effect ‚úì

This is the same effect you'd see in real photos with a wide-angle lens! üì∏
